### Development Guidelines

1. Follow the existing code style and conventions
2. Use TypeScript for all new code
3. Ensure all components are properly typed
4. Write meaningful commit messages
5. Test your changes before committing
6. Keep accessibility in mind when adding new features

## Deployment Instructions

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `swedish-healthcare-demo-site` (must match this name for the configuration to work)
   - **Description**: Swedish healthcare practice website
   - Set repository to **Public** (required for GitHub Pages)
   - **Initialize with README**: Uncheck (we already have one)
4. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Local Repository to GitHub

1. After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with repository URL
2. Copy the repository URL (it will look like: `https://github.com/your-username/swedish-healthcare-demo-site.git`)
3. In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
cd swedish-healthcare-demo-site
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/swedish-healthcare-demo-site.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Pages"
4. Under "Build and deployment", select "GitHub Actions" as the source
5. GitHub Pages is now enabled and will automatically deploy your site using the GitHub Actions workflow

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

1. After pushing to GitHub, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically start
2. To check the deployment status:
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Click on the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - You should see a green checkmark if the deployment was successful
3. Once completed, your site will be available at: `https://your-username.github.io/swedish-healthcare-demo-site/`

## Configuration Details

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The deployment is handled by the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file, which:

- Triggers on push to the main branch
- Sets up a Node.js environment (version 18)
- Installs dependencies and builds the project
- Deploys to GitHub Pages using the official GitHub Pages action
- Uses the repository name dynamically for the base URL

### Vite Configuration

The `vite.config.ts` file is configured with:

- Base path set to `/swedish-healthcare-demo-site/` to match the repository name
- Output directory set to `dist`
- Path alias `@` pointing to the `src` directory for cleaner imports

### Vue Router Configuration

The `src/router/index.ts` file is configured with:

- `createWebHistory(import.meta.env.BASE_URL)` to work with GitHub Pages
- This ensures all routes work correctly with the GitHub Pages URL structure
- Routes include: Home, About, Services, Contact, FAQ, Healthcare Guide, Book Appointment, My Pages, Accessibility, Clinics, Patient Information, and Careers

### Environment Variables

The project uses environment variables for configuration:

- `VITE_BASE_URL`: Set dynamically during deployment to match the repository name
- `.env.production`: Contains production-specific environment variables

## Troubleshooting

### 404 Errors on Page Refresh

If you encounter 404 errors when refreshing pages on GitHub Pages, this is normal behavior for single-page applications on GitHub Pages. The GitHub Pages workflow includes a 404.html file that redirects to the index page, which should handle this issue.

### Build Failures

If the build fails in GitHub Actions:

1. Check the error message in the Actions tab
2. Ensure all dependencies are properly listed in package.json
3. Verify that your code compiles correctly by running `npm run build` locally

### Styling Issues

If styles don't load correctly:

1. Verify that the base path in `vite.config.ts` matches your repository name
2. Check that all asset paths are relative or use the base path

### Local Development Issues

If you encounter issues during local development:

1. Clear your node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`
2. Ensure you're using Node.js version 18 or higher
3. Check that all environment variables are properly set

## Customization

### Changing the Repository Name

If you want to use a different repository name:

1. Update the `base` property in `vite.config.ts` to match your new repository name
2. The Vue Router will automatically use the new base path through `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`
3. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically use the new repository name

### Adding Custom Domains

To use a custom domain with GitHub Pages:

1. Follow GitHub's instructions for setting up a custom domain
2. No changes are needed in the project configuration

### Adding New Pages

To add new pages to the site:

1. Create a new Vue component in the `src/views/` directory
2. Add a route in `src/router/index.ts`
3. Update the navigation components if needed
4. Test the new page locally before deploying
